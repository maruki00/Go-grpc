# Order Management Service (Go gRPC)

This repository contains a basic implementation of an Order Management service using gRPC with Go. It demonstrates a structured project setup with separate directories for command-line tools, internal logic, Protocol Buffer definitions, generated code, and service implementation.

## Overview

This example provides a foundational structure for an Order Management service. While the current commit history indicates initial file uploads, the intended functionality likely involves:

* Defining service contracts for managing orders (e.g., creating, reading, updating, deleting orders).
* Implementing the server-side logic to handle order-related operations.
* Potentially including a client to interact with the Order Management service.

**Key Components:**

* **`cmd/`:** Likely intended to contain command-line interface (CLI) applications for interacting with the service (e.g., a client application).
* **`internal/`:** Expected to house the core business logic and data access layers of the Order Management service.
* **`proto/`:** Contains the Protocol Buffer (`.proto`) definition(s) for the Order Management service and its data structures. This is the contract between the client and the server.
* **`protogen/golang/orders/`:** Contains the generated Go code from the `.proto` definition(s). This code provides the gRPC client and server stubs, as well as the Go representations of the messages.
* **`README.md`:** This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
* **`go.mod`:** The Go module definition file, tracking the project's dependencies.
* **`go.sum`:** Contains the cryptographic hashes of the dependencies listed in `go.mod`, ensuring reproducible builds.
* **`main.go`:** The main entry point for the gRPC server application.
* **`makefile`:** A build automation tool that likely contains commands for generating code, building the server and client, and potentially running tests.
* **`serviceOrder.go`:** Likely contains the Go implementation of the Order Management service defined in the `.proto` file.

## Prerequisites

* **Go:** Version 1.16 or higher is recommended. You can download and install Go from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/).
* **Protocol Buffer Compiler (protoc):** Required to compile the `.proto` file(s) into Go code. You can find installation instructions here: [https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/).
* **Go gRPC and Protocol Buffer Go plugins:** These are necessary for generating Go gRPC code from the `.proto` file(s). Install them using:
    ```bash
    go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
    go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
    ```

## Getting Started (Initial Setup)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/maruki00/Go-grpc.git](https://github.com/maruki00/Go-grpc.git)
    cd Go-grpc
    ```

2.  **Generate Go gRPC code:**
    Navigate to the root of the repository and run the following command to compile the Protocol Buffer definition(s) located in the `proto/` directory. Assuming your `.proto` file is named `orders.proto`:
    ```bash
    protoc --go_out=./protogen/golang/orders --go-grpc_out=./protogen/golang/orders proto/orders.proto
    ```
    **Note:** Adjust the output paths and the `.proto` file name according to your actual file structure within the `proto/` directory.

3.  **Build the Server:**
    Navigate to the root of the repository and use the `go build` command to build the server:
    ```bash
    go build -o server main.go
    ```
    This will create an executable file named `server`.

4.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    ./server
    ```
    The server will likely start and listen on a specific port (defined in `main.go` or related configuration).
